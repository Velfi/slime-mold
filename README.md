# Slime Mold

A slime mold sim written in Rust

## Quickstart

After cloning the project, copy `simulation_settings_template.toml` and rename it to `simulation_settings.toml`. This file configures the simulation and can be changed while the sim is running so you can see the effects of your changes in real time.

Run the sim with `cargo`:

```sh
cargo run --release
```
